HI! 
my name is Maryam Saleh, I am 21 years old, I am from Pir Jo Goth a small town in District Khairpur.
I am currently studying computer science in PAF KIET University in karachi. I hope to become a successful programmar one day.
I am really passionate about computers, and I am always looking for new ways to learn and improve my skills.

We are four siblings in total, with me being the eldest, I have a younger sister and 2 younger brothers
.When I was a child I wanted to become an astronaut because I Love space and enjoy watching space documentaries and learning about cosmolgy.
I Like spending time with my family and friends, Now that I am  busy in studies and completing my assignments on weekends, I dont have a lot of free time
but when I do I usually spend it watching movies or listening to my favourite playlists.
My favourite colors are black and pink as it is obvious from the layout and color theme of my portfolio.</h2> </section>
